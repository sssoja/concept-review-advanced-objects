<h1>Review</h1>
<ul>
<li>The object that a method belongs to is called the <i>calling object</i>.</li>
<li>The <code>this</code> keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object.</li>
<li>Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.</li>
<li>The value of <code>this</code> depends on where the this is being accessed from.</li>
<li>We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.</li>
<li>JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.</li>
<li>The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed.</li>
<li>Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.</li>
<li>Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.</li>
<li>There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.</li>
</ul>
